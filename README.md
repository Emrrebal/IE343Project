This code provides a greedy solution of facility location problem. Here we start with a while module in order to end the algorithm when we reach the p value. In while module, first we found 1 - median location for the first facility at optimal place by summing up the total distance from each customer to facility. After finding the location of first facility, we assigned customers according to their distances from lower to higher. While doing those procedures, we have if condition also while loop to prevent the capacity excess. Furthermore, we have 2 arraylists which keep track of assigned and unassigned points. Then, we have a hashmap module to keep track of relationship between facility and customers and this algorithm repeats in while loop p times so it repeats the same thing again and again until the opened facilities reached the p value. When the problem size is increased , the execution time is also increases because we have a complexity of PCN. We have one while loop with p complexity, in while loop, we have 2 nested for loops which have complexity of n(facility number)and c(number of customers).
